To contribute with your own translations:

Make sure to always use the files from the EN folder since that is the one I will update when there's new entries to translate.

1. Clone the branch for the language you are translating, for example PL for Polish. If no branch exists, clone the main repo and create a new branch using the country code for the branch name.
2. Add your translated files and create a pull request.
3. If you want credit on the mod workshop page, provide the username you want to use for credit. If none is provided I will use your github username.
